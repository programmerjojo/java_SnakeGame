# java_SnakeGame


This is a Snake Game that I have programmed using Java and Eclipse!
Very fun game to make and play :D

<p>How Game works....</p>
<p>You control a snake with arrow key</p>
<p>Goal is to eat apples which add a block to the end of your snake... make your snake as long as possible</p>
<p>Avoid collisions with the walls and your own body!</p>
