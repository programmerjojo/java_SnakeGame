# java_SnakeGame

<p>This is a Snake Game that I have programmed using Java and Eclipse! Very fun game to make and play :D</p>

<ul>
  How Game Works...
  <li>You control a snake with arrow key</li>
  <li>Goal is to eat apples which add a block to the end of your snake... make your snake as long as possible</li>
  <li>Avoid collisions with the walls and your own body!</li>
</ul>
