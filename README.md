# java_SnakeGame


This is a Snake Game that I have programmed using Java and Eclipse!
Very fun game to make and play :D

How Game works
*You control a snake with arrow key
*Goal is to eat apples which add a block to the end of your snake... make your snake as long as possible
*Avoid collisions with the walls and your own body!
